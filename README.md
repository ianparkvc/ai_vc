AI-Powered VC Investment Committee Simulation

What if 20 VCs reviewed your pitch deck?

AI_VC is an AI simulation project that analyzes startup pitch decks through the perspectives of 20 real-world VC and thought leader personas. Each persona independently evaluates using their unique investment philosophy and framework, and a selected panel of 3 engages in a 5-round IC (Investment Committee) debate.

How It Works
Submit Pitch Deck → 20 Independent Reviews → 3-Person Panel Selection → 5-Round IC Debate → Final Report
4-Stage Analysis Pipeline:

Independent Review — 20 personas independently evaluate with their own frameworks (Invest / Pass / Dig Deeper)
Panel Selection — Bull, Bear, Wild Card 3-person panel formation
5-Round IC Debate — Simulating real investment committee attack, defense, and consensus process
Final Report — Comprehensive verdict + action plan generation
